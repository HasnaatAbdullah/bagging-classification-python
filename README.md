# bagging-classification-python
Implementation of Bootstrap Aggregating (Bagging) for classification tasks using Python and Scikit-learn. This project demonstrates how to apply bagging techniques on a dataset, improve model stability, and evaluate performance using ensemble learning methods.
# 🧠 Bootstrap Aggregating (Bagging) for Classification with Python  

This repository contains a practical implementation of **Bootstrap Aggregating (Bagging)** for classification using **Python** and **Scikit-learn**. Bagging is an **ensemble learning technique** that combines multiple models trained on random subsets of the dataset to improve accuracy, reduce variance, and handle model instability.
